"""The deterministic half of the agent — everything that must NOT depend on a model.

Why this exists as its own suite: `test_behaviour.py` drives the real model, so it is slow,
non-repeatable, and it costs money. On 2026-07-28 a day of iterating exhausted the project's
monthly Gemini spend cap, which meant the bounds logic — pure integer and time comparisons —
could not be tested at all. That is backwards. The rules that decide whether the agent may
ACT are exactly the rules that should be testable offline, in a second, forever.

It is also where the bugs actually were. Every failure we hit in the capability work was in
this layer, not in the model's judgement: a slot that ended after closing time, a quantity
compared as a string, a gate that matched phrasing instead of intent.

Run:  python3 test_rules.py        (no venv needed — nothing here imports the model SDK)

ISOLATION: every module store is redirected into a temp directory before anything runs.
Without that this suite would overwrite the real capabilities.json and delete live bookings —
which is precisely the kind of destructive surprise a "safe" unit test should never spring.
